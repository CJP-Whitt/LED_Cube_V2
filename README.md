# LED CUBE V2
Arduino LED Cube

This is the repo for the second version of my LED Cube design. Improvements are mainly involved in the assembly process. Now I can make these cubes using custom made PCBs that have LEDS soldered on them. Instead of having to lay and hotglue strips in a spiral fashion inside two halfs of a cube I can now layout the entire cubue unfolded and put each of the sides PCBs down and then wire them up and fold it all up at the end for a very clean finish.
